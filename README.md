This project is a clone of Apple's calculator. It is capable of just binary operations (+, -, *, /).
Like with all other calculator apps, the calculator is prepared to respect the priority of parentheses, multiplication or division over sum or subtraction.
When the result appears, we can see the operation that was made in the output to get that result. And with the result, we can continue doing some operations.
